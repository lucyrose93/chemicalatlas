# 🧪 Chemical Atlas: Proof of Concept

**Chemical Atlas** is an interdisciplinary multimedia platform that begins to map (or explore ways of mapping) the sprawling, complex, and ongoing reverberations of chemical pollution. This is not a comprehensive atlas—pollutants operate across too many spatio-temporal scales. Instead, this project focuses on **cross-disciplinary collaboration**, methodological resources, and storytelling to better understand and communicate uneven chemical relations.

## 🌍 Project Goals

- 📌 Create an **interactive, online platform** that maps chemical pollution
- 🧬 Integrate insights from:
  - Ethnography
  - Natural sciences
  - Visual arts
  - Citizen science
  - etc.
- 🗺 Go beyond 'conventional' cartography to include:
  - Air quality and extraction maps
  - Ethnographic narratives
  - Audio-visual documentation
  - and more!

## 🧭 Why It Matters

Mapping pollution is more than plotting data on a map. It's about making sense of harm across spatiotemporal scales through multiple ways of knowing—scientific, social, legal, and artistic. This project invites contributors from all fields to co-create a richer, more-than-human view of environmental degradation and modes of resistance.

## 🤝 Community of Practice

The project is in its early stages. We held a [workshop](./workshop) on June 6, 2025, at UCL with researchers and journalists to gather ideas from our community of practice. Based on this input, we are currently creating a proof of concept. As the project gains momentum, we welcome expressions of interest from any discipline:

- 🎥 Filmmaker or artist
- 🧑‍🔬 Natural scientist
- 🧑‍⚖️ Social scientist
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community organizer or citizen scientist
- ❓ Other interested party
